#  Smart URL Safety Checker

> **"Detect phishing links before they detect you."**  
> A machine learningâ€“powered Flask web app that intelligently predicts whether a given URL is **safe or phishing**â€”in real-time.

##  Abstract

Phishing remains one of the most common and dangerous cybersecurity threats, deceiving users into sharing sensitive information via fake links. This project presents a web-based application powered by machine learning to automatically detect phishing URLs by analyzing over 30 URL-based features.

Using models like XGBoost and Random Forest, the system can distinguish between legitimate and malicious URLs with high accuracy, all accessible through a simple, clean web interface built using Flask.

##  Introduction

In an increasingly digital world, phishing attacks have grown more sophisticated and widespread. Users often lack the tools or awareness to identify whether a URL is trustworthy. This project is a step toward closing that gapâ€”using artificial intelligence to **automate phishing detection**.

The goal is to empower users with a fast, accurate, and reliable tool that evaluates any URL they enter and provides an instant risk assessment.

##  Project Overview

The Smart URL Safety Checker is a full-stack machine learning project with:

-  A Flask-based **web application** interface
-  A feature extractor that analyzes **URL structure and patterns**
-  A machine learning model (XGBoost) trained on a labeled dataset of phishing and legitimate URLs
-  Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, and confusion matrix
-  Deployment-ready architecture for local or cloud hosting
